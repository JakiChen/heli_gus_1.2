            Objective<br>
            Explore, develop and define a brand vision for a new running brand providing a learning experience for runners to gain control and obtain a new and better running behaviour.

            The Setio® identity is build from the concept of "Control". Becoming a runner in control of mind and feet is a process of progress. The first step to becoming a runner in control is to acknowledge that you can become better and enter a zone of progress. Once you start to progress you get closer and closer to control.</div>
