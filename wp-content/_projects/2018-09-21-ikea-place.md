            Objective<br>
            The idea of placing virtual objects in the real world has been around for sometime but the technology has never really been good enough. With the launch of Apple’s newly relased ARKit we we’re asked to conceptualize, art direct and design the AR app of IKEA.

            <br><br>
            Concept<br>
            Allowing the many people to virtually place furniture in the own homes will help them unleash their imagination of home furnishing. While at the same time enabling IKEA to “open” millions of new showrooms globally trough people’s smartphones. The power of the smartphone and argumented reality brings IKEA closer to the people and people closer to IKEA.</div>
        <div data-name="bot">
            Design<br>
            Our approach of the design has been to create an interface that feels as natural and intuitive as possible. IKEA is after all for the many. Aesthetically we’ve focused on bringing the IKEA brand to life trough small details while making sure the core experience is so simple, almost invisible —allowing people to focus on unleashing their imagination.

        <div data-name="top">For most people, IKEA Place will be their first interaction with AR.
            </br></br>
            When designing the app our focus has been to design a natural and familiar interface using traditional UI elements and conversational interaces in context of the camera.
            </br></br>
            In this way people will know what to expect and feel confident when placing their first virtual object in real-life.</div>

        <div data-name="top">Experiencing furniture trough AR is the currently the closest we can get to experiencing it in real-life. The app enables people to not only view furniture from one angle – it allows you to walk around it, see it from above and below. You can even explore the details of the materials by walking close to the furniture.</div>

        <div data-name="top">The design is centered around the experience of the camera and the furniture people place within. Dynamically the design system adapts to multiple devices and sizes — allowing everyone in the world with an iPhone 6s and up to use the app.</div>
