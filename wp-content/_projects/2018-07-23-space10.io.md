            Objective<br>
            Redefine the space10.io framework with a modular approach making it easy to update and maintain while providing users with an ever changing playful experience of content, user interaction and community engagement.

            Concept<br>
            Our strategy was to bulid a design system that was based on the idea of spaces. Spaces meaning a free area of expanse which consists of width (X), height (Y) and depth (Z). Spaces are in a sense another word for using modules but spaces allows for a more felixible system. This strategy left us with the challenge to explore and define what digital spaces are, how they relate, connect, animate and behave.

            Result<br>
            The design direction is inspired by swiss graphic design from the 1960’s where the focus was to create a strong system of typography, colors and compositions. Given that there is a vast amount of content the approach of the style is to define an editorial and timeless aesthetics with room for details using both layout, functionality and animation.
