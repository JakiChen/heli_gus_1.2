            Concept<br>
            The brandname mitte® means "middle" in german. It's a reflection of finding balance. It's also the name of the area where the brand resides.</div>
        <div data-name="bot">
            Design<br>
            The design direction is defined as an approachable, natural and new classic brand tapping into a simple and functional aesthetic that caters to the lifestyle of young global citizens.</div>

        <div data-name="top">Brandmark & signature<br>
            The brandmark serves as the icnoic element of the mitte® identity. It's a simple graphic translation of the brandname which is created by placing a solid circle in the middle of a rounded sqaure. The idea of the mark is adopted from the negative space that appers between the "i" and the "t" of the brandsiganature.
